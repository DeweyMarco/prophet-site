            <h2>About Prophet</h2>
            <p>Prophet is a cutting-edge bug finding tool that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize software testing. We fine-tune these models with reinforcement learning, enabling them to reason and utilize various tools to efficiently identify bugs in code.</p>
            <p>Prophet is not just a tool; it's a paradigm shift. It's the answer to the challenges of the LLM-powered coding revolution. It's the personal QA tester every developer needs. Join us in building a future where code is both powerful and reliable.</p>

            <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
                <h3>More Software Developers</h3>
                <p>LLM's have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for software development. We believe that this is awesome. By translating natural language into functional code, LLMs are empowering individuals with limited programming experience to create software. As LLMs continue to evolve, they are poised to further expand the pool of potential developers, fundamentally changing how software is conceived and built.</p>
                <h3>More Software Bugs</h3>
                <p>LLM's can generate impressive code snippets, they often lack the deep understanding of context, the nuanced reasoning, and the rigorous testing needed for robust, production-ready software. The result? Bugs are slipping through the cracks, sneaking into production environments, and causing chaos for businesses and users alike.</p>
                <h3>Software Tools</h3>
                <p>The traditional defenses against these bugs (manual testing, code reviews, quality assurance, standard tools) are struggling to keep pace. They're slow and expensive and often fail to catch the subtle, insidious bugs that LLMs can inadvertently introduce.</p>

            <h2>How Prophet Works</h2>
                <h3>Intelligent Automation</h3>
                <p>Prophet leverages the power of LLMs, but not just any LLMs. We're finetuning them with reinforcement learning, teaching them to think like expert bug hunters.</p>
                <h3>Deep Reasoning and Tool Use</h3>
                <p>Prophet uses a chain-of-thought approach. It reasons about code, strategically employs testing tools, and executes unit tests, all in an automated, self-improving loop.</p>
                <h3>Seamless Integration</h3>
                <p>Prophet seamlessly integrates into the developer's workflow through a VS Code extension. No more switching between tools, sending your code out for code review, or waiting hours for a test suit to run, all of which disrupt your flow.</p>
